---

## 🎨 Coding Standards

### Python Version

- **Use Python 3.11.x** exclusively
- Do not use features from Python 3.12+ that are incompatible with 3.11
- Check compatibility before adding new dependencies

### Code Quality

All code contributions must:

1. **Follow PEP 8** - Python's official style guide
2. **Pass linting** - Use `flake8` for linting
3. **Include type hints** - Use Python type annotations where applicable
4. **Be well-documented** - Include docstrings for all functions and classes
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Use proper exception handling
6. **Be tested** - Include unit tests for new features

### Code Organization

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep routes, services, and utilities separate
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/class should have one clear purpose
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - extract common logic
- **KISS Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - avoid over-engineering

### Naming Conventions

```python
# Variables and functions: snake_case
user_name = "John"
def calculate_total_price():
    pass

# Classes: PascalCase
class RAGService:
    pass

# Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10_000_000
API_VERSION = "1.0.0"

# Private methods/variables: prefix with underscore
def _internal_helper():
    pass
```

### Import Organization

Organize imports in the following order:

```python
# 1. Standard library imports
import os
import asyncio
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

# 2. Third-party imports
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from pinecone import Pinecone

# 3. Local application imports
from services.rag_service import RAGService
from routes.clip_routes import router
```

---

## 📝 Style Guide

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes:

```python
def process_document(file_path: str, chunk_size: int = 1000) -> List[str]:
    """
    Process a document and split it into chunks.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the document file
        chunk_size: Maximum size of each chunk in characters

    Returns:
        List of text chunks extracted from the document

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If chunk_size is less than 100

    Example:
        >>> chunks = process_document("document.pdf", chunk_size=500)
        >>> len(chunks)
        42
    """
    pass
```

### Type Hints

Always use type hints for function parameters and return values:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Union

async def fetch_user_data(
    user_id: str,
    include_metadata: bool = False
) -> Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, int]]]:
    """Fetch user data from the database."""
    pass
```

### Error Handling

Use specific exception types and provide helpful error messages:

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException

async def upload_file(file: UploadFile):
    """Upload and process a file."""
    try:
        # Validate file type
        if not file.filename.endswith('.pdf'):
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=400,
                detail="Only PDF files are supported"
            )

        # Process file
        content = await file.read()

    except HTTPException:
        # Re-raise HTTP exceptions
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        # Log unexpected errors
        print(f"Error processing file: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=500,
            detail=f"Failed to process file: {str(e)}"
        )
```

### Async/Await

Use async functions for I/O operations:

```python
# Good: Async for I/O operations
async def fetch_embeddings(text: str) -> List[float]:
    """Fetch embeddings from the API."""
    response = await client.get_embeddings(text)
    return response.embeddings

# Bad: Blocking I/O in async function
async def fetch_embeddings_bad(text: str) -> List[float]:
    response = requests.get(f"api/embeddings?text={text}")  # Blocking!
    return response.json()
```

### Logging

Use proper logging instead of print statements:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

async def process_request(data: dict):
    """Process incoming request."""
    logger.info(f"Processing request with {len(data)} items")
    try:
        result = await perform_operation(data)
        logger.debug(f"Operation completed: {result}")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
        raise
```

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, UploadFile, File
from pydantic import BaseModel

router = APIRouter()

class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    """Request model for chat endpoint."""
    query: str
    max_tokens: int = 1000

class ChatResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response model for chat endpoint."""
    answer: str
    sources: list[str]

@router.post(
    "/chat",
    response_model=ChatResponse,
    summary="Chat with documents",
    description="Send a query and get an AI-generated answer based on uploaded documents.",
    tags=["RAG"]
)
async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
    """
    Chat endpoint for question-answering.

    This endpoint uses RAG to answer questions based on the uploaded documents.
    It retrieves relevant chunks and generates a response using Google Gemini.

    Args:
        request: Chat request containing the query

    Returns:
        ChatResponse with answer and source citations

    Raises:
        HTTPException: If no documents are uploaded or query fails
    """
    pass
```
